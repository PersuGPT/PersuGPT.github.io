Plus, the relief it provides can be priceless.", "Alright, I might be willing to give it a try. But I don't know any acupuncturists in the area.", "<b>Intent to Strategy Reasoning</b>: Providing Linda with local referrals can make it easier for her to take action and try acupuncture.</br><b>Selected Strategy</b>: Provide local referrals", "No problem, Linda!
